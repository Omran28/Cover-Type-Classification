## 📊 Dataset
Dataset: [Forest Cover Type dataset (UCI ML Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype)  

- **Features:** 54 features  
  - 10 numerical (e.g., Elevation, Slope, Aspect)  
  - 44 categorical (one-hot encoded for soil type and wilderness area)  
- **Target:** Cover type (classes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7)  

**Filtering and label mapping:**
```python
train_filtered = train_transformed[train_transformed["Cover_Type"].isin([1, 2, 3, 6, 7])]
X = train_filtered.drop(columns=["Id", "Cover_Type"])
y = train_filtered["Cover_Type"]
label_map = {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 6: 3, 7: 4}
y = y.map(label_map)
